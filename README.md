# Chrome extension: "WeWork Team"

## Background

[WeWork](https://www.wework.com/fr-FR) is a company that provides coworking space in a lot of cities around the world (NewYork, London, Paris, Tokyo, ...).
With the "All Access" subscription, a _coworker_ can register a room or a desk for the day in any available building.

However, if a _coworker_ wants to meet his colleagues nothing in the registration platform can give him the appropriate information.

That's is why:

> As a _coworker_, I want to know who has a reservation where and when, so that I can meet my colleagues.
